# Skypicker Client

To install dependencies use `npm install` or `yarn install` - yarn is preferable over npm!

If you don't have yarn yet, just simply install with `npm install yarn -g`

Development: `yarn start`  
Production: `yarn run build`

## About responsiveness
There is a lib called `repture` which is a stylus extension included in the app. This is responsible for easier mediaqueries. Use this for painless screen-size handling.
